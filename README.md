(See Youtube videos, timestamps are included)

## Permissions
My Spot may request the following permissions:
- (required) an icloud account to upload, download, or browse spots hosted with cloudkit
- location services to create a spot
- camera access to take a photo of spot
- notifications to alert users when new spots are added to their area.

## Libraries Used
```swift
import Swiftui
import MapKit
import Combine
import CloudKit
import UIKit
import Vision
```


## Installation
In order to run this project with cloukit:

- you must change signing and capabilities to your own apple developer accont with an icloud container
- that container must be in entitlements as well
- the discover tab will load indefinitely until a spot is uploaded as public
- the container must also allow for sorting by creation date and distance in indexes


## TODOS
Features:
- Re-design detail view
- add section to find users in discover
- app clip (ios 16 only, this is due to cloudkit only available in app clips in ios 16)
- support new ios 16: better ipad screen size handling, share views
- Mac support
- Update detail view map to use uikit mapview and add cluters in of map annotations + satellite view
- Make filters + search a half sheet (ios 16)

Clean-up:
- Create generic cruid funtions for cloudkitâ€¦clean up entire cloudkit view model
- Create view models for each view and inject that view model instead of the model itself 
- Remove spot data from defaults and change iMessage app to use core data
- refactor names, create a naming convention and give more thought to names

Bugs:
- None at the moment :) (at least none found yet)

Business:
- Create github pages website and replace wordpress
- Monetize app
